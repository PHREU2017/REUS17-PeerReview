\section{Findings}
- We implemented three different scoring functions to test on our data set, BDe, BIC, and ML.  After training our data we applied each of the scoring functions on our network and found that (insert best method) was the most accurate way to score the data.Thus, we used the results from this network to make our predictions. 
- Insert the photos of the best network 
- Provide a Graph of the AUC-ROC curve which illustrates a comparison amongst the different classifiers.
