\section{Discussions}
With our findings we can contribute accurate medical predictions that reveal the probability of cardiovascular issues happening later on in a patients life.  Given this knowledge we can aid the medical field in producing treatments that take a more patient-specific approach than before.  Enabling doctors to take precautionary measures earlier in a patients life to prevent cardiovascular problems such as Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) or more specifically Myocardial Infarction (MI) from occurring. Which can ultimately assist in reducing the substantial amount of Americans who suffer from Coronary Heart Diseases.
