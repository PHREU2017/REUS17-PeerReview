\section{Findings}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bayesian Network structures were learned using Hill-Climbing, Grow and Shrink, Incremental Association, and Semi-Interleaved HITON-PC. For the hill-climbing algorithm, three different scoring metrics were used: BDe, BIC, and ML. After training our data we applied each of the scoring functions on our network and found that (insert best method) was the most accurate way to score the data.Thus, we used the results from this network to make our predictions. 
    \item Insert the photos of the best network 
    \item Provide a Graph of the AUC-ROC curve which illustrates a comparison among the different classifiers.
    \item discuss interesting connections in the network
