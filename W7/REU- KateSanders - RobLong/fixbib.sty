abstract = {BACKGROUND In white populations, computed tomographic measurements of coronary-artery calcium predict coronary heart disease independently of traditional coronary risk factors. However, it is not known whether coronary-artery calcium predicts coronary heart disease in other racial or ethnic groups. METHODS We collected data on risk factors and performed scanning for coronary calcium in a population-based sample of 6722 men and women, of whom 38.6{\%} were white, 27.6{\%} were black, 21.9{\%} were Hispanic, and 11.9{\%} were Chinese. The study subjects had no clinical cardiovascular disease at entry and were followed for a median of 3.8 years. RESULTS There were 162 coronary events, of which 89 were major events (myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease). In comparison with participants with no coronary calcium, the adjusted risk of a coronary event was increased by a factor of 7.73 among participants with coronary calcium scores between 101 and 300 and by a factor of 9.67 among participants with scores above 300 (P{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons). Among the four racial and ethnic groups, a doubling of the calcium score increased the risk of a major coronary event by 15 to 35{\%} and the risk of any coronary event by 18 to 39{\%}. The areas under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves for the prediction of both major coronary events and any coronary event were higher when the calcium score was added to the standard risk factors. CONCLUSIONS The coronary calcium score is a strong predictor of incident coronary heart disease and provides predictive information beyond that provided by standard risk factors in four major racial and ethnic groups in the United States. No major differences among racial and ethnic groups in the predictive value of calcium scores were detected.},

abstract = {Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of death worldwide. Although a mul- titude of cardiovascular risks factors have been identified, CHD most likely reflects ac- tually complex interactions of these factors even over time. Today's datasets from lon- gitudinal studies offer great promise to un- cover these interactions but also pose enor- mous analytical problems due to typically large amount of both discrete and continuous measurements and risk factors with poten- tial long-range interactions over time. Our investigation demonstrates that a statistical relational analysis of longitudinal data can easily uncover complex interactions of risks factors and actually predict future coronary artery calcified (CAC) plaque levels — an indicator of the amount of CHD present in an individual—significantly better than tra- ditional non-relational machine learning ap- proaches. The uncovered long-range interac- tions between risk factors conform to existing clinical knowledge and are successful in iden- tifying risk factors at early adult stage. This makes it possible to design patient-specific treatments in young adults to mitigate the risk later. Copy},

@article{Karlamangla2005,
abstract = {Our objectives were to describe the trajectories of biological risk factors of cardiovascular disease in young adults, and to study the association of socioeconomic status (SES) with aggregate risk scores that summarize longitudinal risk accumulation from multiple risk factors. We used data from a prospective, bi-racial, cohort study of 18–30-year-old adults in the USA, initiated in 1985, with 10-year follow-up. SES was measured by parental education level, financial hardship during the study, and the participant's education level by the end of the study. We studied growth patterns of seven biological risk factors for cardiovascular disease using a semi-parametric, class-mixture model to identify clusters of individuals with distinct growth trajectories. Risk scores that summarize risk from all seven risk factors were created to reflect risk at baseline, longitudinal risk change over 10 years, and total accumulated risk. Multivariable regression was used to study their associations with SES within each race/gender group. We found tracking of all seven risk factors: in each case, the cluster with the highest baseline value maintained its position as the highest-risk cluster over the next 10 years. After adjustment for age, lifestyle, and healthcare access, SES was associated inversely with baseline risk score in women (black and white), with risk change score in all four race/gender groups, and with accumulated risk score in women (black and white) and in white men. Our findings suggest that individuals with high overall cardiovascular risk in midlife can be identified by their relatively higher values of risk factors in younger ages and that socioeconomic differences in cardiovascular risk start accumulating early in life.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study estimated the amount of weight change in a biracial cohort of young adults and the separate components attributable to time-related and aging-related changes, as well as identified possible determinants of weight change. METHODS In this population-based prospective study of 18- to 30-year-old African-American and White men and women, body weight and prevalence of overweight were measured from 1985/86 to 1992/93. RESULTS Average weight increased over the 7 years, increases ranging from 5.2 kg (SE = 0.2, n = 811) in White women to 8.5 kg (SE = 0.3, n = 882) in African-American women. Significant time-related increases in weight, ranging from 2.0 kg (SE = 1.0) in White women to 4.8 kg (SE = 1.0, n = 711) in African-American men, accounted for 40{\%} to 60{\%} of the average total weight gain. Aging-related increases were also significant, ranging from 2.6 kg (SE = 0.8, n = 944) in White men to 5.0 kg (SE = 1.1) in African-American women. The prevalence of overweight increased progressively in each group. Decreased physical fitness was most strongly associated with weight gain in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS The observed dramatic time-related weight gains, most likely due to secular (period-related) trends, are a serious public health concern.},

@article{Friedman1997,
abstract = {Recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisingly simple Bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among features, called naive Bayes, is competitive with state-of-the-art classifiers such as C4.5. This fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. In this paper we evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on the theory of learning Bayesian networks. These networks are factored representations of probability distributions that generalize the naive Bayesian classifier and explicitly represent statements about independence. Among these approaches we single out a method we call Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), which outperforms naive Bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness that characterize naive Bayes. We experimentally tested these approaches, using problems from the University of California at Irvine repository, and compared them to C4.5, naive Bayes, and wrapper methods for feature selection.},

abstract = {This report describes the relationships between scores obtained on the Cook-Medley Hostility (Ho) scale and race, education, gender, and age in a sample of 5115 young adult participants in a prospective study of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors. Large differences were observed in total Ho scale scores and in six recently identified subsets according to race, education, gender, and age. Young black males with limited education had the highest Ho scale levels (mean = 26.2) while older white females with more education had the lowest levels (mean = 15.5). In all subgroups, education was inversely associated with hostility. The findings suggest a possible mechanism whereby CHD risk is higher in males than females, in the less educated than the more educated, and in blacks than whites. In all race and gender subgroups, total Ho scale scores and the six subsets were positively correlated with negative life events and negatively correlated with social support, supporting a pattern of psychosocial vulnerability found in other studies.},

@article{Daly,
abstract = {Bayesian networks have become a standard technique in the representation of uncertain knowledge. This paper proposes methods that can accelerate the learning of a Bayesian net-work structure from a data set. These methods are applicable when learning an equivalence class of Bayesian network structures whilst us-ing a score and search strategy. They work by constraining the number of validity tests that need to be done and by caching the re-sults of validity tests. The results of experi-ments show that the methods improve the per-formance of algorithms that search through the space of equivalence classes multiple times and that operate on wide data sets. The experi-ments were performed by sampling data from six standard Bayesian networks and running an ant colony optimization algorithm designed to learn a Bayesian network equivalence class.},

@article{Heckerman1995,
abstract = {Abstract. We describe a Bayesian approach for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of prior knowledge and statistical data. First and foremost, we develop a methodology for assessing informative priors needed for learning. Our approach is derived from a set of assumptions made previously as weil as the assumption of likelihood equivalence, which says that data should not help to discriminate network structures that represent the same assertions of conditional independence. We show that likelihood equivalence when combined with previously made assumptions implies that the nser's priors for network parameters can be encoded in a single Bayesian network for the next case to be seen--a prior network and a single measure of confidence for that network. Second, using these priors, we show how to compute the relative posterior probabilities of network structures given data. Third, we describe search methods for identifying network structures with high posterior probabilities. We describe polynomial algorithms for finding the highest-scoring network structures in the special case where every node has at most k = 1 parent. For the general case (k {\textgreater} 1), which is Np-hard, we review heuristic search algorithms including local search, iterative local search, and simulated annealing. Finally, we describe a methodology for evaluating Bayesian-network learning algorithms, and apply this approach to a comparison of various approaches.},

@article{Vol2012,
abstract = {This article reviews the topic of Bayesian networks. A Bayesian network is a factorisation of a probability distribution along a directed acyclic graph. The relation between graphical d-separation and independence is described. A short ar-ticle from 1853 by Arthur Cayley [8] is discussed, which contains several ideas later used in Bayesian networks: factorisation, the noisy 'or' gate, applications of algebraic geometry to Bayesian networks. The ideas behind Pearl's intervention calculus when the DAG represents a causal dependence structure and the relation between the work of Cayley and Pearl is commented on. Most of the discussion is about structure learning, outlining the two main approaches, search and score versus constraint based. Constraint based algorithms often rely on the assumption of faithfulness, that the data to which the algorithm is applied is generated from distributions satisfying a faithfulness assumption where graphical d-separation and independence are equivalent. The article presents some considerations for constraint based algorithms based on recent data analysis, indicating a variety of situations where the faithfulness assumption does not hold. There is a short discussion about the causal discovery controversy, the idea that causal relations may be learned from data.},

@inproceedings{Boutilier1996,
abstract = {Bayesian networks provide a language for qualitatively representing the conditional independence properties of a distribution. This allows a natural and compact representation of the distribution, eases knowledge ac- quisition, and supports effective inference algorithms. It is well-known, however, that there are certain inde- pendencies that we cannot capture qualitatively within the Bayesian network structure: independencies that hold only in certain contexts, i.e., given a specific as- signment of values to certain variables. In this pa- per, we propose a formal notion of context-specific in- dependence (CSI), based on regularities in the condi- tional probability tables (CPTs) at a node. We present a technique, analogous to (and based on) d-separation, for determining when such independence holds in a given network. We then focus on a particular quali- tative representation scheme—tree-structured CPTs— for capturing CSI. We suggest ways in which this rep- resentation can be used to support effective inference algorithms. In particular, we present a structural de- composition of the resulting network which can im- prove the performance of clustering algorithms, and an alternative algorithm based on cutset conditioning.},

In this pa-per, we define a new method of compiling based on variable elimination (VE) and Algebraic Deci-sion Diagrams (ADDs). The approach is impor-tant for the following reasons. First, it exploits lo-cal structure much more effectively than previous techniques based on VE. Second, the approach al-lows any of the many VE variants to compute an-swers to multiple queries simultaneously. Third, the approach makes a large body of research into more structured representations of factors relevant in many more circumstances than it has been pre-viously. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that VE can exploit local structure as effectively as state–of–the–art algorithms based on condition-ing on the networks considered, and can sometimes lead to much faster compilation times.},

@article{Zhang1996,
abstract = {A new method is proposed for exploiting causal independencies in exact Bayesian network inference. A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as ``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms.},

abstract = {Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of death worldwide. Although a mul- titude of cardiovascular risks factors have been identified, CHD most likely reflects ac- tually complex interactions of these factors even over time. Today's datasets from lon- gitudinal studies offer great promise to un- cover these interactions but also pose enor- mous analytical problems due to typically large amount of both discrete and continuous measurements and risk factors with poten- tial long-range interactions over time. Our investigation demonstrates that a statistical relational analysis of longitudinal data can easily uncover complex interactions of risks factors and actually predict future coronary artery calcified (CAC) plaque levels — an indicator of the amount of CHD present in an individual—significantly better than tra- ditional non-relational machine learning ap- proaches. The uncovered long-range interac- tions between risk factors conform to existing clinical knowledge and are successful in iden- tifying risk factors at early adult stage. This makes it possible to design patient-specific treatments in young adults to mitigate the risk later. Copy},
